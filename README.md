# Bridge connection for Beef MS estimation

 
## Object

We proposed the bridge connection for end-to-end networks without any pre
or post processing step, implementing segmentation of beef eye-muscle area and estimation of MS. In particular, the bridge connection interlink a classification network and segmentation network, transforming the segmentation information to classification networks for way to improve the classification performance. We applied it to connect U-Net with ResNet50 and Xception for automated beef MS grading. In addition, bridge connection is also
simple to use for any other automated systems demanding both classification and segmentation task since it doesnâ€™t need to create a new deep learning network but simply combines two existing networks.

##  Installation
The pre-trained weight must exist as `resnet_weights.h5` and  `xception_weights.h5` in the path where `main.py` is located. pre-trained weight can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8x43bGvKinJRwiTPb-A6eOr9pMvvxDi.
